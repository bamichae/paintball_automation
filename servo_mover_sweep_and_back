/*
 * This program demonstrates how the servo motor can be used in an Arduino program.
 * The motor will rotate 180 degrees and then quickly rotate back before repeating the process.
 * This example assumes that the signal wire for the motor is connected to PIN 10 on the Arduino.
 * 
 * Author: Mr Offner
 **** Modified By Ben Michaels for variable slow sweep ****
 * 
 * Parts Needed:
 *  Arduino                     x1
 *  USB Cable                   x1
 *  Servo motor                 x1
 *  Male-to-male jumper wire    x3
 *
 * Construction:
 *  Connect the three jumper wires to the three wires from the servo
 *  The BROWN wire from the servo goes into GND
 *  The RED wire from the servo goes into 5V
 *  The ORANGE wire from the servo goes into PIN 10
 *
